The Sequel stored procedure allows administrators and those with proper clearance to modify reference types, specifically for the Award Typing in this case. In doing so, they will be able to identify which Award Types are being utilized and those which are not. With this information, types that are being currently employed will be unable to be deleted, however this process still allows for the modification of this information in the case of spelling errors or duplicate entries. The Cast expression will return a bit noting whether or not the type has been selected anywhere throughout the application. The C# Service and Controller serve as the middle tier and serve to connect the front end of the MVC (which is written in React) to the back end.
